**Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)** is a set of guidelines and standards for securing software, hardware, and information systems within the Department of Defense (DoD). STIGs are developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to provide security configurations and best practices to ensure the security of DoD systems and networks. The primary goal of STIGs is to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture and compliance of systems used by the DoD.

## Key Aspects of STIG Process

### Documentation

- STIGs are documented guides that outline security requirements and configurations for specific technologies.
- Each STIG provides detailed information on security settings, checklists, and procedures for implementation.

### Security Controls

- STIGs define specific security controls and settings to be applied to systems to ensure compliance with security policies.

### Checklists

- STIGs often include checklists that system administrators can use to verify and validate the implementation of security controls.

### Compliance and Auditing

- STIGs help organizations ensure compliance with security policies and standards.
- They provide a basis for security audits and assessments to evaluate the security posture of systems.

### Automation

- Some STIGs include automation scripts and tools that can be used to automatically apply recommended security configurations.

### Updates

- STIGs are regularly updated to address emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and changes in technology.
- Organizations are encouraged to stay current with the latest versions of STIGs.

### Applicability

- STIGs are designed for use in various environments, including classified and unclassified systems.
- They are applicable to a wide range of technologies commonly used in military and government settings.

### Collaboration

- STIG development involves collaboration between DISA, the vendor community, and subject matter experts to ensure comprehensive and effective security guidelines.
